    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. They're all for 'im&mdash;the dear doctor. Won't 'e be
      pleased when 'e comes back and finds all this little lot! 'E went off
      quite sudden two days ago. Gone to see a patient, I expect, none ever
      comes 'ere, so 'e must go to them, <i>(crosses L., looks in mirror)</i>
      Oh, why was I born so rudely 'ealthy? <i>(on sofa)</i> I would like to be
      'is patient. I'd a-bear anythin' with the dear doctor to see to me, 'e's
      got sich a sorft 'and. <i>(jumps off sofa and stands C. looking at aunt's
      picture, curtseys)</i> I wonder if she's 'is fancy? 'Er with the diamond
      combs. You ain't the only one, my lady, with diamond combs! I'll struggle
      with yer. <i>(produces combs from her pocket)</i> Tenpence a pair&mdash;in
      the Strand, <i>(going to put them on, stops)</i> No, I'll wait till 'e
      comes 'ome. They're all for 'im, the dear doctor&mdash;all for 'im! <i>(end
      of sofa)</i>

      up cigarette end off ash tray and smokes it)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b> <i>(down C.)</i> Lor, you don't say! An' printed invitations
      an' all. <i>(takes card from mirror)</i> 'Ark at this! "Mrs. O'Hara
      requests the honor of Doctor Sheppard'ss company&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. 'E won't come back for that. I wish 'e would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Why not, <b>Tupper</b>? Where's 'e gone? <i>(comes C.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Gie us a kiss, an' I'll tell yer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(moving away)</i> A kiss! There's bloomin' cheek! I
      never did!

    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(coming to her)</i> Oh yes, you did&mdash;only larst
      Friday, an' it's Friday agin, an' what's more, it's <i>Lady</i> Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(innocently)</i> Is it, <b>Tupper</b>? Well, as it's <i>Lady
      Day</i>. <i>(puts her cheek up, aside)</i> It's all for 'im! <i>(kiss
      Bus.)</i> Now tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. 'E's gorn to get married, <i>(goes down r. puffing
      cigarette hard)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(with concern)</i> No, <b>Tupper</b>, don't say that! <i>(changes
      her tone)</i> I mean, 'ow do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(turning round)</i> Gie us another, an' I'll tell yer!

      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(impatiently)</i> Oh, there, then! <i>(kissed him&mdash;aside)</i>
      They're all for 'im!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Well, as you know, <i>(gets on table)</i> <b>Aurora</b>.
      the doctor's a wonderful gentle gentleman, as gentle as&mdash;well, there
      'e is gentle!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(more impatiently)</i> I know that. I give you them
      kisses to tell me summat I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Well, I'm goin' to. When 'e was packing to go away, 'e was
      that excited 'e couldn't 'ardly strap the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Well, what o' that? A gentleman can get excited without
      gettin' married, yer silly kid! <i>(goes to steps)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Ah, but 'e put on a new frock coat, an' a bran noo pair o'
      trarsers&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. The dear doctor! I'll bet 'e looked a toff! <i>(start on

    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. An' then 'e 'ad a brandy and soda&mdash;wot for? <i>(up to

    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. 'Cos 'e was thirsty, o' course, yer silly kite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Thirsty! It was to bring 'im up to the scratch!

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Yes, I was loored into these under false pretences. When
      Mrs. O'Hara engaged me, she says she'd let orf 'er ground floor to a very
      risin' doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. So 'e is! The day <i>will</i> come, 'e'll be the most
      risin'&mdash;<i>(gesticulates with feather-duster, on steps, nearly falls)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Do you want to 'ear abart my trarsers, or do you not? <i>(sits
      on couch)</i>

    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Yes, <b>Tupper</b>, o' course I do&mdash;get 'em orf yer
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Well, Mrs. O'Hara, <i>she</i> sez, 'e'll find yer in
      clothes, she sez, an' think of all the gratooities&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Great&mdash;who?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Gratooities from grateful patients&mdash;shillins an'
      'arf-crowns, she sez. Well, we been at it three months to-day&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(sadly)</i> An' not a blessed patient 'as called yet. <i>(comes
      down)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. No, but the <i>tailor's</i> called, lots o' times, an'
      larst time 'e was very cross&mdash;said 'e'd 'ave these clothes orf me if
      they wasn't paid for Lady Day. <i>(crosses to R. of table)</i>

      <b>Aurora</b>. Oh! the person! Never mind; the day will come.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Well, never mind, look at all these&mdash;all from lady
      patients, <i>(sits in Doctor's chair, puts on his eye-glasses)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(laughing)</i> Lady patients! Why, they're bills. That's
      the butcher, <i>(puts it down)</i> An' that's the chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Oh! 'e can read!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(puts it down)</i> I know 'em all! <i>(reads)</i>
      "Cummerbund and Co., Tailors." Oh lor! That's me! <i>(drops the pack
      suddenly)</i> I call it downright selfish of the doctor to go away and
      never think of me. <i>(produces crumpled telegram from pocket)</i> Oh, I
      forgot, this is for you! <i>(hands it to her)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Silly kid!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Who's it from? Your young man? <i>(reads wire over <b>Aurora</b>'s
      shoulder)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(opening it)</i> 'Arf a mo'! It's from the dear Doctor.
      <i>(aside)</i> I'd know 'is 'and writing anywheres, it's sich a sorft

      &mdash; have &mdash; my &mdash; tea &mdash; ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(counts words on his fingers&mdash;sadly)</i> There's
      extravagance. Blues a tenpence on a telegram, an' my clothes owin' for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b> <i>(aside)</i> 'Ave 'is tea ready! That I will! As if I
      wouldn't 'ave it ready whenever 'e comes, bless 'im! <i>(stuffs telegram
      in bosom, then fusses about room, putting things straight, starts scouring
      bureau)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(watching her)</i> I believe you're in love with the
      "Dear Doctor." <i>(picks another fag end off ash-tray and lies on couch
      smoking it)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Oh, go smoke! Little boys should be seen and not heard!

    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(snatches ladder quickly and goes to the door, saying to
      herself)</i> 'Arf 'is, indeed! No! It's all for 'im&mdash;all for 'im!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Exit <b>Aurora</b>. L. U. E.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(laughs)</i> That's <i>sure</i> to be for the missus.
      She 'as lots o' callers. She's a widder. If I was a woman, I'd be a
      widder. <i>(jumps off couch)</i> Oh lor, if it's the tailor, <i>(crosses
      to fire, stands back to it, legs apart)</i> I wouldn't mind so much, only
      I sold my old clothes to 'ave a bit on a dead cert, wot didn't come orf&mdash;dead
      certs never do&mdash;I wish my clothes was a dead cert.

    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(to <b>Tupper</b>)</i> Ah, you hear what his grateful
      patients think of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(comes down)</i> Grateful patients? <i>(shakes head
      sadly)</i> No, miss, not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. You carry the medicine round, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. No, sir, not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. But you're the doctor's boy, aren't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. No, miss, not yet&mdash;only 'arf of me, the other 'arf
      belongs upstairs. You see, the doctor ends orf where the stair-carpets
      begin; 'e shares me with the missus&mdash;an' 'e shares the gal too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(rises, coughs)</i> Ahem! That will do! Is the room
      always so full of smoke?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(coming to him quickly)</i> Oh yes, sir, wuss generally,
      <i>(flaps wet flannel in his face)</i> The doctor's a wonderful gentleman
      for smoke, 'e lies on that couch smokin' all day long, an' read in' this
      'ere book, <i>(fetches it)</i> You look at it. <i>(comes down C.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Girls go up to her,)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't make 'ead nor tail of it, 'cep' the pictures, an' they is&mdash;well,
      there!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Ahem! That will do! <i>(takes it from her before his
      daughters see it)</i> What are the doctor's hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. I dunno, sir&mdash;all hours. Sometimes out all day.
      Sometimes don't come home all night&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Ahem! That will do!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Wednesday 'e went out, an' ain't back yet
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Two days ago? That lady's case must be serious! <i>(comes to
      back of sofa and sits L. end)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. It is serious, miss, I tell yer. <i>(confidentially)</i>
      It's a case of&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(yells in her ear)</i> Ahem! <i>That</i> will do!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Sorry I spoke!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Very unusual for smoke to hang about for forty-eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. Oh,that's nothin', sir. 'E's wonderful unusual in 'is
      'abits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. 'As a biled egg for 'is dinner orfen. <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> Poor fellow! He must be starving!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Tupper</b> looks admiringly at <b>Ruby</b>. and goes to fire,
      stands back to it, legs apart.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>., <i>(aside)</i> "Poor fellow!" He'll be rich enough before
      the day's out. It's hard not to tell one's own daughter&mdash;but I
      mustn't betray a professional confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(aside)</i> Fine gels! <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>)</i> 'E'll be
      wonderful glad to see you, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. 'Cos 'e's settin' up as a ladies' Doctor. miss, an' you're
      the fust callers we've ever 'ad. <i>(aside)</i> Bar the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. The first? <i>(to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> He <i>is</i> starving!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Oh, 'e'll cure yer, whatever yer got. <i>(crosses to <b>Plant</b>)</i>
      He's wonderful clever. 'E'd see through you, sir, weskit an' all. 'E don't
      hax no hex rays to tell 'im. <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>)</i> 'E knows all what's
      goin' on in yer innards&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Ahem! That will do. Er&mdash;no doubt, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. No bloomin' doubt, sir. <i>(going to him)</i> But I do 'ope
      you'll pay afore leavin'&mdash;'cos it's Lady Day, an these 'ere clothes
      ain't paid for yet&mdash;an' if they ain't&mdash;they're a-comin' orf.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. That'll <i>do!</i> We don't want to hear any fairy tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tupper</b>. <i>(sadly)</i> There ain't no tails about these 'ere. <i>(looking
      at his jacket)</i> It's a norrible fac'!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. You can go&mdash;<i>(to <b>Tupper</b>)</i> both of you. <i>(to
      <b>Aurora</b>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(having fetched pail&mdash;to <b>Tupper</b>)</i> Come
      aw'y, you talk too much. <i>I'm</i> the doctor's local demon when 'e's
      aw'y.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Exeunt <b>Tupper</b> and <b>Aurora</b>.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Nice sort of servants for a doctor to have. <i>(puts book on
      couch)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>. who is reading a letter)</i> Who's that
      from?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Lieutenant Merry!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Oh, let me read it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(They read it together.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside)</i> A thousand a year for an unbusinesslike young
      fool, and here am I, her own cousin's husband, and she's never given me a
      penny, except what I've borrowed. <i>(Bus. with pocket hairbrush, mirror
      at back)</i> I did think my chance had come when she sent for me to
      Cumberland. I got the hair-dresser to touch out all the grey ones,
      thinking I might fetch the old girl, but as soon as she saw me she was
      very rude, called me a fright, and began asking some damned awkward
      questions about my late wife's trust money. Just my luck! <i>(sits at
      writing table)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(reading from letter which <b>Ruby</b> holds)</i> "And,
      my darling <b>Ruby</b>&mdash;if your father dies"&mdash;there's not much
      "if" about it. He does. <i>(taps her hair)</i> I've seen the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Both giggle.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside, looking in pocket mirror)</i> So I took the next
      train back to Southsea, and romped my daughters up to town. If <b>Ruby</b>
      can only hook the doctor before the aunt arrives, I'm saved&mdash;if she
      can't&mdash;I'm&mdash;ahem!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(aside to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> And only think, <b>Pearl</b>.
      when he's an Admiral, I shall be Lady Merry&mdash;perhaps a Duchess!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. But, father&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Oh, he'll be delighted. We're keeping it as a surprise for
      his birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. He'll be 63 next birthday&mdash;he looks more like 36.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Both laugh.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(to them)</i> Stop that silly giggling! <i>(crosses over
      to the two, sends <b>Pearl</b> across to table)</i> Go and sit over there.
      <b>Ruby</b>. my precious jewel, I have something very solemn to say while
      we are waiting to see the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(jumping up, excitedly)</i> Pa, don't say you've brought
      us for the doctor to sound us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(quietly, sitting still)</i> He shan't sound <i>me!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. On the contrary, I've brought you to sound the <i>doctor</i>,
      <i>(pulls <b>Ruby</b> down again and sits r. of her on couch)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(excitedly)</i> What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. You are aware that although we are strangers to Doctor
      Sheppard, he is our cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Second cousin, pa!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. On mother's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Three times removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Well, well, let us hope he won't be so far removed in the
      future. I regret very deeply that we have never yet enjoyed the friendship
      of&mdash;er&mdash;<i>dear</i> cousin Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. You have frequently remarked, it was not worth while to
      cultivate <i>any</i> of our poor relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(hotly)</i> Do you want your pocket money stopped? The
      fact is. <b>Pearl</b>. you're bringing my grey hairs&mdash;&mdash;<i>(stroking
      his black locks)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(quietly)</i> Your what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(jumping up)</i> I stop your pocket money for a month!
      Ooh! <i>(puts his hand to his back)</i> This lumbago is unbearable. When a
      man gets to my time of life&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(quietly)</i> What time is it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(hotly)</i> I stop your pocket money for <i>three</i>
      months!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(rises)</i> Really, father, a solicitor should be more
      cautious. I meant to say the time is getting on, <i>(points to clock and
      crosses to couch&mdash;stands behind <b>Ruby</b>)</i> and you have not yet
      informed us of the "very solemn" something you have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. I accept your explanation&mdash;without prejudice. <i>(stands
      R. of couch)</i> I say when a man gets to my time of life&mdash;the future
      happiness of his offspring becomes an all-engrossing theme. You are aware
      that when exalted personages contemplate a matrimonial alliance, they
      neyer look outside the family. Living as we do, in so fashionable a resort
      as Southsea, we cannot be too &mdash;er&mdash;"tony" in such important
      matters. Now you are both&mdash;as I know, being your father&mdash;heart-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Pearl</b> digs <b>Ruby</b> hard in the ribs.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(crying out)</i> Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. How dare you interrupt me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. I didn't, pa, it was&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Sneak! <i>(pinching her arm)</i> <b>Ruby</b>. It was
      nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Pearl</b> sits in big armchair.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(aside to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> Little cat!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. I accept your explanation, without prejudice. You have heard
      from that stupid Buttons what a noble character the doctor bears, and no
      man is a hero to his&mdash;his Buttons. The <i>one</i> thing the doctor
      wants is a <i>wife.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. To look after his buttons?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Silence, miss! And you, my dear <b>Ruby</b>, my favourite, I
      mean my first-born, have all the qualifications for a doctor's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. A doctor's wife? <i>(looks at <b>Pearl</b>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. It has always been the dream of my life to see you united in
      matrimony to <i>dear</i> Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>Cheap</i> Jack! He hasn't a penny!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Oh hasn't he?&mdash;er&mdash;<i>(aside)</i> Nearly let it
      out that time, <i>(to her)</i> I mean should he be clever enough to win my
      <b>Ruby</b>. my <b>Ruby</b> mine&mdash;er&mdash;this afternoon, he will be
      rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Alas, I have no dowry to give you, save
      the blessing of your dear old&mdash;your dear fond, <i>fond</i> father, <i>(kisses
      her forehead)</i> But only obey me in this, and Lady Fortune will smile on
      us all&mdash;smile&mdash;<i>smile</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(bursts into tears)</i> I can't smile&mdash;I won't! <i>(turns
      to <b>Pearl</b>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(comes to meet her&mdash;aside to her)</i> Of course you
      won't&mdash;I'll get you out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(angrily)</i> Stop that silly crying. He'll be in soon,
      and you look a perfect fright with your eyes all red. You've never obeyed
      me in your life&mdash;either of you&mdash;but I've made up my mind this
      time, and damme&mdash;I'll make you obey me. I swear <i>that dear cousin
      Jack shall be my son-in-law.</i> <i>(crosses C.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(going quietly to him, standing between him and <b>Ruby</b>)</i>
      If such is your determination, I will sacrifice myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(contemptuously)</i> You!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(rushing to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> You shan't!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. I will&mdash;what is it after all? Marriages aren't made in
      heaven now-a-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. No, no, <b>Pearl</b>. you're too good. I'd rather marry him
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. You can't&mdash;you know you can't&mdash;you're engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Sneak! <i>(pinches her arm)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Pearl</b> howls.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(shouts)</i> Stop quarrelling! Such rivalry between
      sisters is most unseemly. What do I dress you alike for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. To save expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. No, miss, to save <i>jealousy</i>, and I'll have no Jealousy
      about this. Settle it amicably between you, <i>(aside, crosses to R.)</i>
      Good idea! They'll go it faster without me. I'll leave 'em alone with him.
      <i>(aloud)</i> Dear, dear, I've forgotten something I particularly want to
      show Jack. I'll step over to our apartments&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Pa, you can't leave us alone in a bachelor's room!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Hang it, you're cousins, and you're two to one. Now,
      remember, <i>one of you two must marry Jack</i>&mdash;that's my last word,
      and you know my word, like my profession, is law!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Exit <b>Plant</b>.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. We've got a nice thing in fathers, <i>(looking out of
      window)</i> He's brought us up to London to put us on the market
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Yes, and by a cheap excursion. <i>(goes L.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Now we know why we've come to encamp just across the street&mdash;it's
      to lay siege to a penniless cousin. <i>(picks up "Quayle on Muscles" off
      couch, takes it to table)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(at small table up stage L., opens case, shrieks)</i> Ach!
      knives!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(looks up from book)</i> <i>You</i> wouldn't do for a
      doctor's wife, whatever Pa says, <i>(looks at picture)</i> Besides, you're
      not free, but I am. <i>(sadly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <b>Pearl</b>. there's Waverly! <i>(coming to her, looking
      over her shoulder at picture)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Yes, there's Waverly, but he's <i>(turns to next picture)</i>
      most disappointing. He's been staying at Southsea with Lieutenant Merry
      for a whole week, <i>(turns page)</i> and father's been away the whole
      time. <i>(turns page)</i> And I've given him every possible encouragement.
      <i>(looks at picture)</i> At least, of course I didn't go so far as <i>you</i>
      did with Lieutenant Merry. You were&mdash;simply&mdash;<i>(turns page)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(looking at picture)</i> Shocking! <i>(shuts book and puts
      it back on couch)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Yes, you were! <i>(laughs)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. How dare you! I never gave Andrew the slightest
      encouragement, <i>(sits on sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. My dear <b>Ruby</b>. I judge by results. He proposed to you
      the second day. <i>(comes and sits by her on sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. What about you? You let Waverly kiss you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Only once&mdash;just there; <i>(touches her cheek)</i> and
      that was after a dance, which doesn't count. No, I've gone as far with Mr.
      Vane as any girl, who isn't a born flirt, <i>(pointedly looking at <b>Ruby</b>)</i>
      can go, and he's said nothing&mdash;yet So I'm going to get father to
      invite Doctor Sheppard down to Southsea, and I'll flirt <i>desperately</i>
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Ruby</b> crosses C.)</i>You see, I shall be obeying father&mdash;I
      shall get you out of your difficulty, and it will force <i>Waverly</i> to
      say something&mdash;definite, <i>(sits on the word)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Oh, <b>Pearl</b>! What a clever idea! <i>(thinks)</i> <i>Andrew</i>
      hasn't been <i>quite</i> so attentive since I accepted him. And, as you
      say, dear papa must be obeyed, so I'll flirt with Doctor Sheppard too,
      before Andrew&mdash;it'll do him a <i>world</i> of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Doctor Sheppard!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. No, <i><b>Andrew</b></i>, of course. Oh, <b>Pearl</b>. I
      wonder how they're getting on without us? Do they ever talk about us, do
      you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Of course they do&mdash;<i>everybody</i> talks about us&mdash;in
      Southsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. <i>(heard off)</i> Not in? P'raps he's got a patient. <i>(laughs)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. It's <b>Andrew</b>! How do I look? <i>(jumps up and looks in
      mirror)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Pearl</b> tries to pull her away from it&mdash;Enter <b>Andrew</b>.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Waverly.</b> <i>(looking at girls' backs and nudges <b>Andrew</b>)</i>
      P'raps he's got two patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. Oh, Susannah! <i>(takes double stethoscope off table, aside
      to Waverly)</i> Let's have a lark. I'll pretend to be the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Waver.</b> No, no, never joke about business, <i>(scuffles to get
      stethoscope)</i>
    </p>

      <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(coyly)</i> Mr. Vane! What attraction has brought you all
      the way from Southsea? <i>(follows him)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Waverly looks confused.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>)</i> What's brought you? We called at
      Clarence Parade this morning and found that you'd flown up to London by
      the excurs&mdash;the early train, so we thought what a lark it'd be to run
      up on the chance of meeting you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Waver.</b> We didn't expect to find you at the doctor's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. No. <i>(to <b>Ruby</b>. anxiously)</i> Are you ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(laughing)</i> No.

    <p>
      Waver, <i>(to <b>Pearl</b>. wearily)</i> Don't say it's <i>you</i>.

    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. I'm <i>never</i> ill. What's the matter with you?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. But <i>why</i> have you come to see a <i>doctor</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. <i>(laughs)</i> I haven't&mdash;I've brought Vane to
      introduce him to my old school-fellow, dear old, serious, studious,
      short-sighted, absent-minded Jack Sheppard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b> and <b>Pearl</b>. <i>(together)</i> You know <i>Jack</i>?

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. Cousin Jack! Didn't you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. No, you never told us you <i>had</i> any cousins. What a
      lark! Jack's my greatest friend&mdash;because we're such opposites, I
      suppose. I call him Dull Boy, because "all work and no play makes Jack&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
      see? Rather smart for me, and he calls me "Merry <b>Andrew</b>"&mdash;<b>Andrew</b>
      Merry&mdash;Merry <b>Andrew</b>&mdash;see? Oh, that was Jolly smart for
      Jack&mdash;only joke he ever made.

      <i>(<b>Ruby</b> sits on couch&mdash;<b>Andrew</b> behind couch.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Waver.</b> Why have you never mentioned his name?

    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. We haven't seen him since he was a little boy in kilts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. We saw lots of him then, we were both of us <i>awfully</i>
      in love with him.

      <b>Ruby</b>. And we're longing to see him again! <i>(pointedly)</i>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. I know, come and shoot tin dickie-birds at the Aquarium&mdash;I
      must have exercise.

      don't know how to <i>say</i> it.

      this, <i>(tears up letter and pockets the pieces)</i> I'd better blurt it
      out. <i>(goes to her)</i> I say, it's not&mdash;er&mdash;it's not that.

      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(takes card out of mirror)</i> "Sir Peter and Lady
      Quayle request the pleasure&mdash;&mdash;" That's what did it, that dinner
      of Quayle's. Sir Peter told me over dessert, that for the first six months
      after he started in practice, he was starving. Then he met a young
      governess who was starving too, and with what their friends called
      "sublime imprudence" they got married. <i>And he never looked behind him
      after</i>. Then he said if I meant to get on as a gynaecologist, I must
      get married. "Your wife will prove a mascotte like mine did," he said,
      "and patients will flow in&mdash;simply flow in." Well, I believe in
      Quayle. That was Tuesday night; on Wednesday I ran down to Lowesloft,
      proposed to Flo on Thursday, we were secretly married this morning at the
      Registry Office, she's gone back to her people, and I've come back to
      town; and what do I find? Nothing but bills, and I can't pay one of them.
      After settling for the special license, my fare back to town, and that
      telegram to <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(feels in pocket, produces coppers)</i> I've
      got sevenpence half-penny in the wide world and a wife! It's all Quayle's
      fault! Damn Quayle! I'll never believe in him again. I don't even know
      where my next meal is coming from, <i>(walks up and down)</i>

      or two. There's a lady coming to-morrow who mustn't see you here for
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(by sofa C.)</i> A lady! The first day of our honeymoon!
      Who is she? <i>(pauses)</i> A patient?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(smiling and shaking his head)</i> Better than a hundred
      patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. What's she coming for? Tell me&mdash;tell me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(putting his arm round her assuredly)</i> My dear little
      wifie, she's only my maiden aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Oh, Jack, are you <i>sure</i> she's a maiden aunt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Quite! Here's her letter, <i>(crosses to sofa, takes it
      from his pocket and gives it to her)</i> Now are you satisfied, jealous
      little woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Forgive me, Jack. I can't help being jealous of everybody
      and everything&mdash;I love you so much!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(round on to sofa)</i> I know you do&mdash;and see what
      luck you've brought me. <i>(pointing to letter which she is reading)</i> I
      told you we shouldn't go wrong if we followed Quayle's advice. Auntie's
      coming to-morrow, and she's going to do all that money can&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(reading letter)</i> To-day, Jack&mdash;she's coming <i>to-day</i>.
      This letter was written yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(suddenly)</i> What a fool I am! Where's the Bradshaw?
      <i>(crosses to table, turns over leaves of Bradshaw, hurriedly)</i>
      Ambleside! A! Where's A! Acton, Aldersgate, Ambleside, here we are! Good
      gracious! She's nearly here! <i>(crosses to Flo)</i> Flo, it will never do
      to greet her with a story of a secret marriage&mdash;she'd be simply
      horrified! It's very hard to part&mdash;it's been a short and
      unsatisfactory honeymoon, <i>(kisses her)</i> But&mdash; Where's that
      Bradshaw? <i>(crosses to table, fumbles to find the place)</i> Lowestoft?
      L! L! Where the devil is L?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Enter <b>Aurora</b> with letter.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. 'Ere, sir&mdash;a letter for you, sir&mdash;and the boy's
      waiting, <i>(R. C.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(takes letter)</i> Look out the next train, you <i>must</i>
      catch it! <i>(throws Bradshaw to Flo)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Doctor reading letter&mdash;Flo reluctantly looking out train, in
      Bradshaw, half crying.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(aside)</i> You shall catch it, impudent 'ussy! I see
      yer kiss 'im! They all kiss their dear <b>Doctor.</b> excep' me. <i>(turns
      up her nose at Flo, crosses R. of table c.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(glancing at <b>Aurora</b>)</i> I don't like the look of
      that girl, <i>(starts)</i> She's reading his letter, and <i>I</i> haven't
      seen it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(to Doctor)</i> Any answer, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Yes, I'll write a note to this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(jealously)</i> A lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(aside, reading the letter)</i> I'll learn 'er bloomin'
      symptoms&mdash;I must be 'is patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(watching her)</i> The forward minx! <i>(shuts Bradshaw
      with a bang)</i> I won't go back to Lowestoft. A wife's place is by her
      husband's side, <i>(takes her hat off and sits twisting Bradshaw,
      viciously)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Give the boy this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Yes, sir. <i>(takes note, crosses to Flo)</i> Can I show
      you your place&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Flo indignant.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;in the Bradshaw, miss? P'raps you ain't beyond the A. B. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(haughtily, snatching it back)</i> No, thank you&mdash;I
      can manage myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(aside)</i> Can yer? I'll struggle with yer&mdash;I've
      learnt 'er symptoms, <i>(as she goes out)</i> Impudent 'ussy!&mdash;kissing
      the dear doctor. I'll struggle with yer, my gal!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Exit <b>Aurora</b>.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(looking at <b>Doctor.</b> who is absorbed reading
      letter)</i> He's forgotten me already, <i>(pause)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(rubbing his hands)</i> Good business! Call on you this
      evening, my dear lady&mdash;of course I will! I wish it was time now. <i>(looks
      at watch)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(jealously)</i> Who's that letter from, Jack? <i>(kneels
      on sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> A lady in Grosvenor Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. How long have you known her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> I've never <i>seen</i> her yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Who is she? <i>(stands)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> A patient, Flo&mdash;my first&mdash;at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(with a sigh of relief)</i> Oh, only that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> "Only that!" My dear Flo, a doctor's wife can't afford to
      be jealous. You'll frighten away all my most paying patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Oh, no, Jack, I won't, <i>(runs and kneels by him)</i> I'll
      try and look as if I liked them, but I can't help being jealous. My
      jealousy's only love the wrong side up&mdash;that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> I know it is, and I'm so glad that my first case has come
      when you were here. You are a mascotte indeed! <i>(stoops and kisses her)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. If I stop, I'm sure lots and lots and lots will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(not noticing, absorbed in letter)</i> This is the very
      case I've always been hoping for, and I've got if at last! Just look at
      the gold crest, and the thick paper. No, don't read it. Oh, it's worth
      three guineas a week, if it's worth a penny, and it's a three years' job&mdash;bar
      accidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. What's she got?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Hysterical paraplegia&mdash;she's afflicted with all sorts
      of abnormal fancies and longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Front door bell rings.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(jumping up suddenly from her knees)</i> Who's that?
      Another lady afflicted with all sorts of longings?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(seriously, rubbing his hands)</i> I hope so&mdash;devoutly,
      <i>(rises suddenly)</i> By George! If it's auntie!1 She mustn't find you
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(running about aimlessly)</i> Where shall I go? <i>(crosses
      L., runs towards bathroom R. U. E)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(stopping her)</i> Not in my <i>bedroom!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Why not? I'm your wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Oh, yes, I forgot. But aunt may want to take her things
      off, and if she found <i>you</i> there, the whole story'd have to come
      out, and she might think it was a fairy tale, and that would be awful! I
      know&mdash;on my operating couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(shrieks)</i> Ach! Operating!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Runs down O. P.., crosses R. corner and then round table C., followed
      by <b>Doctor.</b>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> It's all right! It won't bite you! <i>(takes up rug)</i>
      I'll chuck this rug over you. She'll think it's something anatomical.
      She'll never suspect it's my blushing bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Oh, Jack, why should you hide your blushing bride? She's
      sure to find me <i>here</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> No, no, she won't!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. She <i>will! I'm so conspicuous!</i> <i>(sits on sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> The <i>more</i> conspicuous the better, when you want to
      hide anything. It disarms suspicion, <i>(down stage)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(jumps off couch, and stalks down to him in a towering
      rage)</i> Jack! You've done this <i>before!!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Never! I swear! Do help me now, and all will come right, <i>(drags
      her back and covers her up)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(popping her head out)</i> Oh, hubby, are you <i>sure</i>
      we're <i>properly</i> married?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Quite. Lie still, <i>(same Bus.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(same Bus.)</i> It doesn't feel like it a bit. Oh, it's a
      horrid, horrid wedding day! <i>(kicks and disarranges rug)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(putting it back)</i> She's coming! Lie still, do lie
      still! Flo, please&mdash;for my sake! Do lie <i>quite</i> still&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Flo kicks.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      and don't kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Enter <b>Plant</b>.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. My dear cousin Jack! <i>(putting out his hand)</i> I'm so
      glad to find you alone. My mission is of rather a delicate nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Oh, Lord! <i>(looks at couch nervously to <b>Plant</b>)</i>
      I'm rather busy to-day. You couldn't call some other time, could you? <i>(feels
      his pulse)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. My dear Jack, you misunderstand me&mdash;it's not me&mdash;it's
      my precious jewels. I've left them lying in their room, their sobs were
      distressing to hear, they are suffering terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Another case! Quayle's right again! They're
      flowing in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside)</i> Locked up, and serve 'em right. I'll get on
      better without 'em. <i>(aloud)</i> They are both&mdash;<i>( sobs )</i>
      &mdash;both&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Two of 'em! The more the merrier! I'll come at once, <i>(putting
      on his hat)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. No, you misunderstand me&mdash;they are simply overcome with
      the way&mdash;to use their own phrase&mdash;the "affectionate" way in
      which you received them this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> And Flo can hear every word. It's all up!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. They can talk of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Doctor pulls <b>Plant</b>'s coat.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's Jack, dear Jack, darling Jack, <i>(same Bus.)</i> Ah, you have robbed
      me of my precious jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(glancing nervously at couch, with assumed levity)</i>
      Nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(indignant)</i> It's not nonsense at all, it's very <i>serious.</i>
      Heaven forbid that I should speak, harshly to a young man with a rich&mdash;ahem!&mdash;future&mdash;but
      as their father&mdash;from whom they have never had a secret all their
      blameless lives&mdash;&mdash;<i>(crosses R.)</i> I tell you, sir, you have
      broken <i>two</i> hearts in one afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(gloomily)</i> Oh, good afternoon! <i>(sits at table)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(aside)</i> I shall go home by the next train.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. They're wasting the best years of their lives, and all for
      you, sir&mdash;all for you! <i>(cross L., waves his stick excitedly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(half to himself)</i> I can't commit bigamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. I don't ask you to marry both&mdash;<i>(whacks)</i>&mdash;of
      them, but one or the other you must&mdash;<i>(whacks)</i>&mdash;and <i>shall</i>&mdash;<i>(whacks
      on table)</i>&mdash;after all you have said and done, <i>(up)</i> Now, my
      dear sir, <i>(walking about waving his stick C.)</i> I speak to you as a
      bachelor&mdash;<i>(whacks rug with walking stick)</i>&mdash;without
      encumbrances, <i>(whacks)</i> What have you got there? <i>(whacks)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(gets up)</i> My encumbr&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;er&mdash;my
      model! <i>(R. of chair)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Your model?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(intercepting him)</i> Yes, my ana&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Anna?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Anatomical model. Look out, you'll break it&mdash;and these
      things cost money, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. I accept your explanation&mdash;without prejudice, Well, to
      return to our muttons&mdash;I mean my poor lambs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Oh. damn your lambs! <i>(crosses L.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. I ask you, as a father, what are your intentions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Can't tell him I'm married&mdash;he'd tell
      auntie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(severely)</i> Answer me, sir&mdash;what are your
      intentions with regard to my two daughters? <i>(Bus. Flo.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(sofa, aside)</i> If he wasn't my fairy prince, I'd
      brain him! <i>(spots Flo's hat and collars it, confused)</i> Flo's hat! Oh
      &mdash;er&mdash;honourable, you know&mdash;strictly honourable, <i>(tries
      to hide Flo's hat)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(pointing to Flo's hat)</i> What is <i>that</i>, sir? <i>(works
      right round sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(following)</i> A lady's <i>hat</i>, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Don't be flippant, sir. <i>(seizes hat and waves it)</i>
      You're deceiving my girls, two girls with but one Single thought, two hats&mdash;hearts
      that beat for Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(to <b>Plant</b>)</i> I'm deceiving no one&mdash;that
      hat belongs to one of my patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside)</i> A patient, indeed! He's got none. <i>(goes
      for hat)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> A lady in whose case I take the deepest interest. Can't
      tell you&mdash;it would be a breach of professional etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(goes to Doctor over R., throws his hat and stick on
      sofa)</i> Ah, now you're talking business. The legal and medical
      professions are sisters, and should have no secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(shakes his head)</i> No, no, it's a delicate case. <i>(Bus.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Delicate cases are my speciality, and if I can be of any
      assistance to you&mdash;<i>(aside)</i>&mdash;or you to me&mdash;. <i>(aloud)</i>
      I'm at your service. Proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> I'll break it to him gently why I can't
      marry his daughters, <i>(to <b>Plant</b>)</i> Well, to begin with, she's a
      married woman&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Is she? She'll cost her husband a pretty penny in hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(airily)</i> Oh, he can afford it. <i>(speaks low so
      that Flo can't hear)</i> He's a great friend of mine&mdash;in fact, the
      greatest friend I have in all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(loudly)</i> Then what's his wife's hat doing here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> That's just like a d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      lawyer!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(softly)</i> Don't you see, they married secretly, without her parents'
      consent, and she went back to her people, and&mdash;and time went on&mdash;and
      at last she could bear it no longer, so this afternoon she came up to town
      to find her husband&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Your greatest friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Er&mdash;precisely!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside)</i> It's that lieutenant in the navy. I must
      remember that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> And she came straight to me, and she had a fit of hysteria
      and she fell&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Fell?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Yes&mdash;in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Fainted&mdash;fainted! And now she's lying down, and the
      question is, when she recovers, where is she to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Go? To her husband, of course! Where is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> Ah, that's the question!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(aside, popping her head out)</i> I've got the cramp! I
      shall shriek in a minute.

    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(aside)</i> I'll put him under an obligation, <i>(to
      Doctor&mdash;effusively, loudly)</i> My dear cousin, my door is ever open
      to the weary wanderer, and if the fair owner of that hat&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> No, no! It's very kind of you, but I won't hear of it. The
      fair owner of that hat is perfectly comfortable where she is.

      fall in love with. No girl ever fell in love with me except Flo&mdash;dear
      jealous little Flo! Ah, well, I love her all the more for being so

    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(to <b>Pearl</b>)</i> Never mind, she shan't interfere
      with our fun; we can't leave those two sitting in that four-wheeler all
      day. <i>(rises, comes to <b>Pearl</b>)</i>
    </p>

      <b>Pearl</b>. No, come along, We'll go and tell "auntie" to come in.

      their father called.

      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Those precious jewels have said something.

      <b>Pearl</b>. No&mdash;in a four-wheeler.

      discharge that boy&mdash;at least my <i>half</i> of him!

      <b>Ruby</b>. I told her I'd see if you were disengaged, and she scribbled
      her name on her card; here it is. <i>(reads)</i> Miss Susannah Sheppard!

      talk to you. No, no! I don't mean that! I mean I'm awfully glad, of

      a nephew&mdash;he combines all the tenderness of a woman with the more

    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> Tell that to the&mdash;the&mdash;milkman's baby. I could tell

    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> Who's Miss Garden's husband? <i>(back to fireplace)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(R. C, aside)</i> Ahem! I must make a bit out of this,
      anyway. My dear lady, I mustn't betray a professional confidence, by
      mentioning his name, <i>(aside)</i> Even if I knew it, which I don't, <i>(to
      her)</i> But, strictly between ourselves, he's Jack's greatest friend.

    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> Disgraceful! <i>(crosses to table)</i>

      course I shall try and save Jack from the Divorce Court, but it's gone
      rather far, and these things cost money, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> What do you mean? <i>(end of sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Only this afternoon I found her concealed on that couch&mdash;beneath

    <p>
      &mdash;and; when I remonstrated with Jack&mdash;as a father&mdash;<i>(end

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(at table, back to fire)</i> Then, why do you call him a

      of it. <i>(crosses to sofa)</i>

      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Old lady!

      me? Well, I dare-say I deserve it, and I'm awfully sorry, but you know if
      I'd had the slightest notion she'd turn up to-day, I'd never have dressed
      up like that picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(aside)</i> Like what picture?
    </p>
    <p>

      come! Give us your hand and say you forgive.

      <b>Andrew</b>. I didn't mean you&mdash;I always say that&mdash;I mean&mdash;I'm
      most awfully sorry&mdash;can you forgive me? <i>(end of sofa)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> I can and do, because I'm so delighted to find that I've
      misjudged Jack, and that you were the real culprit. Pray tell me to whom I
      am indebted for the unexpected pleasure of my bath?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. My name's <b>Andrew</b> Merry, I'm Jack's greatest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> His greatest friend? Are you a lieutenant in the navy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. I have that honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> What shall I do? I have it. <i>(crosses to bathroom)</i> I've
      a great surprise for you&mdash;but you must not think any the worse of her&mdash;she's

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. <i>(C. aghast)</i> Kiss him? I've never seen this gentleman
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> Mr. <b>Plant</b> told me you were man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. Mr. <b>Plant</b> would say anything horrid!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. Oh, thanks!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. He wants one of his daughters to marry Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Andrew</b>. Does he? Well, <b>Ruby</b>'s engaged to me, and <b>Pearl</b>&mdash;well,
      don't worry about her, and as for dear old Jack, he's only cared for one
      girl all his life. I've never seen her yet&mdash;but he's told me more
      than once that her name was <b>Flora</b> Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Flora</b>. I'll never be jealous again!
    </p>

      You done it all, mum. The dear doctor's never give me the slightest
      encouragement of a word or a look.

    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(with blank astonishment)</i> He never has?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. No, mum. It was all a one side, and I should never 'ave
      'ooked him if you 'adn't said the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> I breathe again, <i>(aside)</i> Jack's a perfect angel, <i>(to

      <b>Plant</b>. How dare you! My daughters are Doctor Sheppard's cousins,
      and nothing would induce me to sanction a marriage between cousins, <i>(going
      to her)</i> You're a very naughty little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(haughtily, seating herself and spreading her frock out)</i>
      Little girl! Pardon me, my good man&mdash;do you know who you're talking
      to? You don't know: my position in this 'ouse. I'm auntie's choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. Are you? You're not <i>mine!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. Yes! She's chosen me to marry the dear doctor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(<b>Ruby</b> and <b>Pearl</b> laugh.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let them laugh as wins. You tried your best, but I don't bear no
      h'ill-will. I said I'd struggle with yer, and I've done it. If you're good
      girls, I may ask you to be bridesmaids&mdash;it's better than nothing, <i>(crosses
      L. C.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. <i>(to Doctor under table)</i> I say, Jack, is this true?
      You have my deepest sympathy&mdash;and if it should come to a breach of
      promise&mdash;look me up!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(coming out)</i> If ever I do look you and your precious
      jewels up, I'll bring a stick twice as big as yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Plant</b>. And that is gratitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Enter Flo. and Aunt&mdash;they listen.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruby</b>. <i>(hotly)</i> I don't care <i>who</i> marries Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pearl</b>. Nor I&mdash;he's not <i>my</i> style!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(to Doctor)</i> This dear girl has told me all about you&mdash;forgive
      me for my mistakes, but they weren't all my fault&mdash;<i>(shaking her
      finger at <b>Andrew</b>)</i> I hope you'll have a very happy married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(crossing)</i> I'm sure 'e will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aunt.</b> <i>(to Doctor)</i> I shall do all I can to make it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>(coming to her)</i> Oh, thank you, mum, and would you
      please name the day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Doctor.</b> <i>(absently)</i> My wife! <i>(sees <b>Aurora</b>. shakes
      her off)</i> Oh, go to! go to&mdash;<i>(goes to <b>Flora</b>)</i> <i>This</i>
      lady is my wife&mdash;we were married this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aurora</b>. <i>My Jack married!</i> Then I'm a widder!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(She falls flat on the stage.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      CURTAIN. <br /> <br />
